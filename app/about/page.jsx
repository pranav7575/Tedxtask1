      <div className="ans1"><p1>TED is a non-profit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. It started as a four-day conference in California 39 years ago, believing passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes and lives and welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world. Today, the two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less, and the total number of events conducted till now is more than 6000. All this has led to a global community focused on change through the power of ideas, thus forming a trinity of ideas from- Technology, Entertainment, and Design, and has recently taken up a broader scope ranging from science and business to global issues.</p1></div>

      <div className="question2">What is<span className="tedx"> TEDx</span> ?</div>
      <div className="ans2"><p1>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a TED-created program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. These events are community driven and are organized by passionate individuals who seek to uncover new ideas and share the latest research in their field of expertise that spark conversations in their communities and ultimately elevate them to a global stage. TEDx events aim to integrate ideas from every nook and corner of the world, thus, extending the boundaries of views and ideas. Our event is named TEDxVITPune, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p1></div>
